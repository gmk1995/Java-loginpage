# Java-loginpage
This is an example of a simple login web application implemented using Java, JSP, Servlet, HTML, and the Maven build tool:
This pom.xml file specifies that the project uses Java 8, and it declares dependencies on the Servlet API, JSP API and JSTL.
You'll need to have Maven installed and configured on your system to use this pom.xml file to build and run the application.
You can use the command mvn clean install to build the application and mvn tomcat7:run to run the application.
